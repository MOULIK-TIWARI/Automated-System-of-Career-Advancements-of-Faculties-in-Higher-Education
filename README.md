# Automated-System-of-Career-Advancements-of-Faculties-in-Higher-Education
OVERVIEW
This project aims to automate the faculty self appraisal process in higher education institutions.
It provides a web-based platform where faculty members can log their academic activites such as research publications, even participations, seminars, projects and lectures, while administrators can access and evaluate the submitted records efficiently.
This system aims to eliminate paper based evaluation promoting transparency and helps university administrators make data-driven decisions regarding faculty developments.
